# Iris Data Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes the classic Iris dataset using Python. It demonstrates basic data exploration, statistical analysis, and data visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Objectives

- Load and explore the Iris dataset
- Perform basic statistical analysis
- Visualize the dataset with multiple chart types
- Gain insights into patterns across Iris species

## Dataset

The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is a classic dataset often used for classification and clustering. It includes 150 samples of three Iris species:
- *Iris setosa*
- *Iris versicolor*
- *Iris virginica*

Each sample includes:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Features

- Load dataset using scikit-learn.datasets.load_iris
- Clean and explore data using Pandas
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Group data by species to find feature means
- Create the following plots:
  - Line chart (mean features by species)
  - Bar chart (average petal length)
  - Histogram (distribution of sepal length)
  - Scatter plot (petal length vs sepal length)

## Visualizations

Plots are included in the notebook to show insights such as:
- How petal size varies by species
- Relationships between features like sepal and petal length
- Feature distributions

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   `bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-analysis.git
   cd iris-analysis
